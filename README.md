# Pick-and-Place-Robot-using Quarky
This repository showcases a Pick and Place Robot built using the Quarky Robot. The project demonstrates basic automation where the robot picks objects from one position and places them at another using servo and motor control programmed in PictoBlox.

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository documents the **Pick and Place Robot Demo Activity** built using the **Quarky Robot**. The project is designed as a **STEM and robotics learning activity**. It demonstrates how robots can be programmed to perform **task-specific automation**, such as picking an object from one location and placing it at another.

## 🛠️ Robot Assembly Summary
### Wheel Sub-Assembly
- Mount motors on the B1 plate
- Attach wheels
- Fix the assembly to the front of the robot
- Connect motors to Quarky motor ports

### Pick & Place Mechanism
- Mount servo motors on B5 plates
- Align the servo shaft with the ‘+’ mark
- Connect servos to **Servo Port 1 & 2**
- Ensure brown wire stays on the **left side**

### Servo Calibration
- Calibrate servos to **90°**
- Ensures smooth movement and avoids motor strain

### Ultrasonic Sensor
- Mount using B2 & B7
